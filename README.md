# Reference
    The installation of the dependency can refer to the link：https://github.com/aharmat/mcptam/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide

   The calibration pattern image is in the calibration_pattern folder. You can print the calibration pattern size as 0.254x0.1905m like me, or you can print it to other sizes, as long as it is guaranteed that the applied actual calibration pattern has the same ratio of width and height with the original calibration pattern image.
